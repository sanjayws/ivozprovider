Current day max usage
#####################

CGRateS calculates price for every external outgoing call placed through non-externally-rated Carrier (see :ref:`Billing`).

Total amount of money spent within a day can be limited using this feature, avoiding call toll fraud (or at least
reducing damages).

.. tip:: Set a reasonable limit for every client so that abnormal money usage is automatically blocked.

More information at :ref:`current day usages`.
